## 📈 Major Insights by Analysis

### 💰 1. Financial Snapshot – Profitability Overview
- **Good Loans:** 86.18% of portfolio generating **$65.57M profit**  
- **Bad Loans:** 13.82% resulting in **$28.25M loss**  
- **Net Profit:** **$37.31M**, confirming overall profitability  
- ✅ *Goal:* Reduce charged-off losses to improve total returns.

---

### 🧑‍💼 2. Employment Length Analysis
- Borrowers with **10+ years** of employment are the **most stable and profitable**.  
- “Less than 1 year” employees form a **high-risk group**, though large in volume.  
- 🏁 *Conclusion:* The bank’s foundation lies in long-term, stable employees.

---

### 💳 3. Loan Purpose Analysis
- **Debt Consolidation** dominates the portfolio — highest funding, revenue, and demand.  
- However, this creates a **single point of business risk**.  
- ⚖️ *Strategy:* Diversify product offerings to reduce dependency.

---

### 🏠 4. Home Ownership Analysis
- **Mortgage holders** receive and return the most funds, confirming **asset-backed stability**.  
- **Renters** form a major risk segment by volume and need stricter underwriting.  
- 🧭 *Insight:* The bank’s financial stability relies heavily on mortgage customers.

---

### 🌍 5. Regional Performance
- **California (CA)** is the top-performing but most risk-exposed state.  
- Heavy regional dependence makes the portfolio vulnerable to local economic downturns.  
- 🌐 *Strategy:* Expand lending to states like **TX, NY, FL** for risk diversification.
